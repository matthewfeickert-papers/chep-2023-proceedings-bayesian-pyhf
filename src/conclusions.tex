\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

The methods presented above are implemented in the Python package \texttt{Bayesian\_pyhf} \cite{BayesianPyhf}. This software package enables the parallel Bayesian and frequentist analysis of multi-channel binned models within the single software framework \texttt{pyhf}. \\
The current interface of the package \texttt{Bayesian\_pyhf} is demonstrated in Fig. \ref{code}.

\noindent Further enhancements regarding the user interface and stability with respect to multi-chain sampling are ongoing. A full integration in the \texttt{pyhf} is also planned.
